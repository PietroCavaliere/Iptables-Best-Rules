#IPTables-Best-Rules
Optimal IPTables Configuration for Attack Mitigation
This project is dedicated to crafting the most effective IPTables configurations to defend against a wide range of cyber attacks. Our focus is on analyzing threats, developing custom rules for prevention, and ensuring system security‚Äîall while maintaining optimal performance and minimizing false positives.

üîß **Dependencies**
Iptables: v1.8.7+
xtables-addons-common: v3.19-1ubuntu1+

üõ°Ô∏è **xtables Modules**
xt_psd:
Detects port scans and mitigates potential threats (Port Scan Detection).
xt_recent:
Monitors and manages recent connections, helping to track and prevent repeated attack attempts (Connection Tracking).
xt_string:
Identifies and filters packets based on specific strings, such as those found in DNS queries, to block malicious traffic (String Matching).

This configuration aims to offer robust protection against various attack vectors while ensuring that your system remains responsive and secure.
